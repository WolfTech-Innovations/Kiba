# MOBILE: KibaOS Mobile rootfs for Halium GSI phones
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Not an ISO. Halium GSI devices boot through boot.img (kernel + Halium
# ramdisk) and the Halium GSI system.img. Following the "Halium-boot"
# porting method, this script fetches the prebuilt, device-agnostic GSI
# directly (no AOSP repo sync) -- but does NOT try to pre-build boot.img
# on this build host anymore. That was tried (fetch a "certified GKI
# kernel" and repack it here) and didn't hold up: Google doesn't publish
# a stable download URL for those, and even where the kernel really is
# generic, assembling a bootable image still needs the device's own
# vendor_boot/dtb -- something a build host with no idea what phone
# it's targeting can't supply. Instead, this ships the ingredients
# (magiskboot + a generic Halium ramdisk) and the installer zip's
# update-binary does the unpack/swap-ramdisk/repack itself, on the
# phone, against that phone's own stock boot/init_boot partition --
# see the boot-repack-tools section below and update-binary further
# down for the actual mechanics. No per-device kernel tree, no
# repo/breakfast/mka, and no KIBA_MOBILE_HALIUM_BOOT_IMG to hand-supply
# either -- but also no pretending a build host can know a phone's
# vendor_boot ahead of time. What this function otherwise produces is
# the userspace: a pacstrap'd Arch
# Linux ARM aarch64 rootfs
# carrying KibaOS's mobile stack (Budgie panel/raven on phoc, ofono,
# Calls, Chatty, squeekboard, libgestures, sddm for lock/login),
# tarred up the same way Manjaro's libhybris/image-ci project packages
# its own Halium rootfs for adb-sideload install onto /data alongside
# the GSI + halium-boot.img.

  # Bottom navigation bar -- Waybar
  # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # Waybar over gtk-layer-shell rather than a bespoke GTK bar: it's the
  # de-facto modern bar on wlroots-based Wayland compositors (same
  # layer-shell protocol phoc/squeekboard already speak here), actively
  # maintained, and themeable entirely through CSS -- so it can carry the
  # exact same design tokens as the OOBE (oobe.css's #0071e3 accent, pill
  # shapes) instead of introducing a second, unrelated visual language
  # for the persistent chrome the user sees on every screen after setup.
  #
  # Reachable actions are necessarily best-effort here: phoc doesn't ship
  # a swaymsg-equivalent IPC or a full foreign-toplevel switching UI like
  # sway does, so "recents" runs wlrctl's toplevel list (wlrctl is built
  # from AUR above) rather than a live-thumbnail switcher -- real data,
  # just not a real switcher UI yet. Worth revisiting once phoc's own
  # protocol support covers richer toplevel management (track
  # https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc issues).

  # to a phone screen, with Material 3 shape/elevation layered on top
  # where a touch UI actually benefits from it: bigger corner radii on
  # touch targets (Material's "extra-large" 28px shape scale vs desktop's
  # 18-20px), real elevation shadows on the Wi-Fi list instead of a flat
  # bordered row (fingers need a stronger affordance than a mouse cursor
  # does), and a top linear progress track like Android's own
  # SetupWizard/LineageOS SetupWizard use instead of relying on step dots
  # alone -- dots stay too, just demoted to a secondary indicator under
  # the header the way Material stepper components use both together.

  # ── Halium GSI (system.img) -- Halium-boot method ───────────────────────
  # NOTE ON PATHS THAT USED TO BE HERE: an earlier version of this script
  # tried a "fast" GSI path through JamiKettunen/cports (hybris branch) --
  # ./cbuild pkg -a aarch64 user/halium-gsi-X.0 -- which turned out to
  # produce a Chimera Linux apk/rootfs, not a system.img; wrong tool for
  # an Arch Linux ARM/pacstrap userspace. After that, this function
  # switched to building the GSI from source: repo init against
  # Halium/android, breakfast the generic halium_arm64 target, mka
  # rawsystemimage -- the "full system image" porting method. That's a
  # ~150GB+ AOSP repo sync and a multi-hour Soong build just to reproduce
  # a system.img that's already device-agnostic and publicly hosted --
  # a lot of build-server time for a file this project has no reason to
  # compile itself.
  #
  # What's actually appropriate here is the Halium-boot method (one of
  # the three porting methods docs.halium.org/UBports document: full
  # system image, Halium-boot, and standalone kernel). Since Halium 9 the
  # GSI is a prebuilt, device-independent artifact by design -- Treble
  # moved every device-specific bit into the vendor partition, so the
  # Halium-boot method just fetches the GSI instead of rebuilding it, and
  # leaves only halium-boot.img (the kernel + Halium ramdisk, genuinely
  # per-device) to be built or supplied separately -- already handled as
  # a manual step in README-INSTALL.md below. That's the right split for
  # this script: it produces the device-agnostic pieces (this rootfs
  # tarball, and now the GSI fetch), and stays out of the per-device
  # kernel build entirely.
  #
  # Default source is the lolinet mirror -- this is the ubports_GSI_installer
  # bundle at mirrors.lolinet.com/firmware/halium/GSI/, confirmed live
  # (directory listing checked directly). NOTE: an earlier revision of this
  # default pointed at build.lolinet.com/file/halium/GSI/halium-10.0/arm64ab/

  # ── boot.img repack ingredients (generic Halium ramdisk + magiskboot) ───
  # Earlier revisions of this tried to pre-build boot.img on the build
  # host by fetching a "certified GKI boot image" from Google and
  # assuming that was enough. Checked that against source.android.com and
  # docs.ubports.com and it doesn't hold up on two counts: (1) Google
  # doesn't publish a stable download URL for certified GKI images --
  # they come from a repo-synced source build or a specific numbered
  # ci.android.com artifact, not a fetchable zip per branch; and (2) even
  # where the GKI kernel itself genuinely is generic, turning it into a
  # bootable image still needs the device's own vendor_boot (dtb, base
  # address, pagesize, cmdline) -- and on Android 13+ the ramdisk isn't
  # even in boot.img anymore, it's a separate per-partition init_boot.img.
  # None of that is something a build host can produce without already
  # knowing the specific device.
  #
  # The fix: don't build boot.img on the host at all. Pull it apart and
  # back together on the *phone*, inside update-binary, where the real
  # stock boot/init_boot partition for that exact device is sitting right
  # there. All this pipeline supplies ahead of time is the two pieces
  # that genuinely are generic -- the Halium ramdisk, and a boot-image
  # (un)packer -- bundled into the zip so update-binary doesn't need
  # network access on the phone. The kernel, dtb, and header metadata all
  # come from the device's own stock image, so they're correct by
  # construction instead of guessed from a version string.
  #
  # For the (un)packer: AOSP's own mkbootimg/unpack_bootimg are Python,
  # and TWRP's minimal busybox environment doesn't reliably have a
  # working python3. magiskboot (topjohnwu/Magisk) is the standard
  # answer to exactly this problem in the wild -- a single static
  # aarch64 binary, no interpreter, that auto-detects and unpacks/repacks
  # any Android boot image layout (plain, vendor_boot, GKI header v3/v4)
  # and is routinely run from inside recovery/TWRP by flashable-zip
  # installers (that's literally what Magisk's own install script does).
  # Pulled from the latest Magisk GitHub release rather than vendored, so
  # this always tracks current boot-image format support.
  # generic (non-per-device) Halium ramdisk. Note this is genuinely
  # `initramfs-tools-halium`'s own "continuous" release artifact --
  # confirmed by reading halium-boot's own get-initrd.sh, which fetches
  # this exact URL pattern when Android.mk builds halium-boot.img the
  # "normal" way. It is NOT `Halium/halium-boot` releases -- that repo
  # doesn't publish a ramdisk artifact at all, it's the bootimg-generator
  # source, not initramfs content.

  # ── TWRP-flashable installer zip ─────────────────────────────────────────
  # Real Halium ports overwhelmingly ship a single TWRP-installable zip
  # rather than making the end user run halium-install by hand (see e.g.
  # the Redmi 4A Ubuntu Touch port writeup: "the ZIP method is preferred").
  # There's no single canonical zip-builder upstream for this -- every
  # port hand-rolls its own META-INF/update-binary -- so this does the
  # same thing: update-binary here is a shell script (the well-established
  # SuperSU/AnyKernel3 trick -- TWRP execs it directly off its #!/sbin/sh
  # shebang instead of treating it as a compiled edify binary, so it
  # works on any arch without a separate build per device), which copies
  # kibaos-mobile-rootfs.img to /data/rootfs.img and the fetched GSI to
  # /data/android-rootfs.img -- filenames per Halium's own documented
  # rootfs.img mount point plus the android-rootfs.img convention used by
  # the Halium/android_device_halium_halium_arm64 output and community
  # install scripts (e.g. JBBgameich's replace-android-image).
  #
  # boot.img isn't bundled pre-built anymore -- the ingredients to build
  # it (magiskboot + the generic Halium ramdisk, fetched a few steps up)
  # ride along instead, and update-binary below does the actual
  # unpack/swap-ramdisk/repack against the *device's own* stock boot
  # (or init_boot, on Android 13+ split-partition devices) at install
  # time. That's what makes this device-agnostic without needing to know
  # the target device ahead of time: the kernel/dtb/header always come
  # from that exact phone's own stock image, never guessed or downloaded.
  # update-binary still only ever touches a partition it can positively
  # identify (slot detection, known by-name paths only, hard fallback to
  # "do it yourself") -- guessing wrong on an unknown device's boot
  # partition is real bricking risk that /data writes don't carry, and
  # that safety story doesn't change just because the repack is now

# KibaOS Mobile — install

This is the KibaOS Mobile *userspace only* (Budgie panel/raven on phoc,
ofono, Calls, Chatty, squeekboard, libgestures, sddm for lock/login),
shipped in three forms:

- `kibaos-mobile-installer.zip` — flash this from TWRP, easiest path.
- `kibaos-mobile-rootfs.img` — the same thing pre-built as a raw ext4
  image (what's inside the zip), if you'd rather push it yourself.
- `kibaos-mobile-rootfs.tar.gz` — the raw tarball, for
  `halium-install`/manual use if neither of the above fits your setup.

None of these are bootable by themselves. You still need, per your
device's Halium port status:

1. `boot.img`/`init_boot.img` — repacked automatically, **on the phone,
   during install** — not pre-built by this pipeline. The zip carries
   `magiskboot` (a static unpacker/repacker) and a generic Halium
   ramdisk; update-binary dumps whatever's actually sitting on this
   device's own `boot`/`init_boot` partition, swaps in the Halium
   ramdisk, and flashes the result back — so the kernel, dtb, and header
   metadata always come from *this exact phone's* stock image instead of
   being downloaded or guessed from a version string. This works
   regardless of Android version/GKI status, since magiskboot
   auto-detects the boot image layout (plain boot.img, GKI header v3/v4
   with a split `init_boot`, etc.) rather than this pipeline assuming one
   ahead of time.

   Defensive by design: update-binary only ever touches a `boot`/
   `init_boot` partition it can positively identify via known by-name
   symlinks with A/B slot-suffix detection, backs up whatever's already
   there to `/data/kibaos-boot-backup/` *before* writing anything, and
   skips the repack outright (rather than guessing) if it can't confirm
   a safe target, if the image is a layout magiskboot doesn't recognize,
   or if it can't find a generic-ramdisk section to swap. Samsung devices
   (no fastboot-flashable boot partition) fall through to the manual
   step regardless. There's no per-device kernel build required either
   way — if the automatic repack can't proceed on a given device, you're
   pointed at building/supplying a `halium-boot.img` yourself rather than
   this silently shipping a broken one.
2. The Halium GSI `system.img` (arm64) -- fetched via the Halium-boot
   porting method (prebuilt, device-agnostic GSI, no AOSP repo sync)
   unless `KIBA_SKIP_GSI_FETCH=1` was set for this run, and already
   bundled into the installer zip as `android-rootfs.img` if the fetch
   succeeded. Standalone copy at `kibaos-mobile-gsi-arm64.img`
   (+ `.sha256`) alongside these files. Source defaults to the lolinet
   mirror (build.lolinet.com/file/halium/GSI); override
   `KIBA_MOBILE_GSI_URL` to pin a specific build/mirror. If the fetch was
   skipped or failed, grab a GSI build manually from the same mirror or
   devices.ubuntu-touch.io -- the zip will say so on install if it's
   missing.

## Install steps (recommended: the zip)

1. Boot (not flash) TWRP or another Busybox-capable recovery, and confirm
   `/data` is unencrypted and formatted ext4 -- wipe/reformat in recovery
   if it isn't.

2. Push and flash the zip:

       adb push kibaos-mobile-installer.zip /sdcard/
       adb shell twrp install /sdcard/kibaos-mobile-installer.zip

   (or do the same from TWRP's own UI: Install → pick the zip → swipe).
   This repacks and flashes `boot`/`init_boot` in place (see item 1
   above — it'll say plainly in the TWRP log if it couldn't and you need
   to sort out a `halium-boot.img` by hand instead), writes `rootfs.img`
   to `/data/rootfs.img`, and writes the bundled GSI to
   `/data/android-rootfs.img`.

3. Reboot. boot.img's initramfs mounts `/data`, loop-mounts
   `/data/rootfs.img`, and `switch_root`s into it -- that's KibaOS
   Mobile's `kibaos-mobile-oobe` first-boot flow starting up, no separate
   disk installer involved.

## Alternative: halium-install (if the zip doesn't fit your device)

Some devices/recoveries don't play well with the shell-script
update-binary trick, or you may want image conversion/renaming handled
for you instead of doing it by hand. `halium-install`
(https://github.com/jbruechert/halium-install -- stages everything on
your host machine first, avoiding old-TWRP/no-busybox headaches) does
the same job from a PC instead of inside recovery:

    git clone https://github.com/jbruechert/halium-install
    cd halium-install
    sudo ./halium-install -p none \
      kibaos-mobile-rootfs.tar.gz kibaos-mobile-gsi-arm64.img

`-p none` tells it this isn't one of Halium's bundled distros
(reference/neon/ut/debian-pm/etc.) -- just install the tarball as-is.
`sudo` is required (the script loop-mounts image files via
qemu-user-static/simg2img). The official on-device installer
(https://github.com/Halium/halium-scripts, `halium-install` in that
repo) works too, but runs its steps over adb shell instead of on the
host, so it depends on the recovery's own userspace being complete
enough (working busybox etc.).

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Unlike the Plymouth theme, this repo ships no Makefile/install script —
# just the two theme directories themselves (Numix-Circle and its lighter
# variant) — so installing it is a straight copy into /usr/share/icons.
# There's no official Arch package either (only an AUR git package that
# builds from this same repo); cloning directly is simpler and keeps this
# script free of AUR/makepkg dependency resolution.
#
# Note: Numix Circle is an APP icon theme only — its index.theme Inherits=
# chain falls back to the base Numix theme (and then Adwaita/hicolor) for
# places/devices/mimetypes/actions. We're not installing the base numix-
# icon-theme here since it wasn't asked for, so non-app icons will fall
# back to whatever adwaita-icon-theme/hicolor already provides. Say the
# word if you want the base theme installed too for full coverage.

/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * KibaOS Organic Motion Language
 * Nothing alive moves with symmetric, linear timing — things settle into
 * rest faster than they drift away from it. These three curves (named for
 * documentation; GTK CSS has no custom-property/var() support, so the
 * literal cubic-bezier values are repeated at each use site below) encode
 * that asymmetry instead of using GTK's default flat "ease":
 *
 *   settle  cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)     — easeOutQuint. Entering a
 *           state (hover, focus, opening). Quick, confident, no bounce.
 *   fade    cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.75, 0)       — easeInQuart. Leaving a
 *           state. Slightly slower than settle — things drift off, they
 *           don't snap off.
 *   spring  cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)   — easeOutBack. Reserved
 *           for ONE thing only: the physical switch knob, where a small
 *           positional overshoot reads as a twig springing back rather
 *           than a robotic snap. Used nowhere else — overusing overshoot
 *           reads as cartoonish rather than organic.
 *   grow    cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)       — easeOutExpo. Reserved
 *           for STRUCTURAL reveals (Raven and the Budgie Menu appearing/
 *           dismissing), never for small in-place state changes. A leaf
 *           unfurling and a light switching on are different kinds of
 *           motion even though both are "something turning on" — settle
 *           is the latter (a value flips, fast and certain), grow is the
 *           former (a whole shape is arriving, slightly unhurried at the
 *           start before resolving quickly). Kept distinct from settle
 *           so the two don't blur into a single generic "ease-ish" feel.
 *
 * Organic radius scale — every corner-radius below is a mild asymmetric
 * quad (top-left top-right bottom-right bottom-left) instead of one flat
 * number on all four corners. The spread is deliberately small (2-6px on
 * surfaces in the 16-28px range) so it reads as machined-but-grown at a
 * glance — closer to a river stone or a leaf edge than a die-cut card —
 * without tipping into the blobby/cartoonish territory a bigger spread
 * would. Applied only to the handful of surfaces that carry the brand
 * (panel, Raven, Budgie Menu, OSD, tooltips, context menus), not to every
 * button and row — restraint matters more than coverage here.
 *
 * Caveat: this only governs GTK widget-state transitions — it's NOT doing
 * compositor-level window drag physics. KWin does ship its own Wobbly
 * Windows effect, but it isn't enabled by default in this image (see the
 * KWIN CONFIG section for the whole story on that), so window dragging is
 * flat/rigid movement for now — nothing to verify here, it's just off
 * until/unless that effect gets turned on. Raven/the Budgie Menu's
 * open/close slide is still Budgie's own compiled animation code, not GTK
 * CSS — the opacity transitions below are best-effort and may be
 * superseded by that native motion. Verify visually.

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# GDM has neither LightDM-gtk-greeter's plain "background=" key nor
# SDDM's QML theming API (see the dead code below, kept for reference) --
# its login screen is just GNOME Shell running in greeter mode, themed
# through the "gdm" dconf system db instead of a greeter-specific config
# file. /etc/dconf/profile/gdm is what tells dconf that the "gdm" system
# user should read the "gdm" db at all (stock gdm ships a profile
# pointing at file-db /usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults, which is
# read-only from this package's own defaults -- system-db here layers
# /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/* on top of that instead of touching the read-only
# file-db). background reuses org.gnome.desktop.background, same key
# the desktop session itself uses; logo is picked up by GDM natively
# through org.gnome.login-screen -- unlike lightdm-gtk-greeter, there
# IS a real logo slot here, so the KibaOS mark actually shows on the
# greeter now instead of being dropped like it was under LightDM.

# ── Wayland session — budgie-desktop-kwinwayland.desktop ────────────────
# budgie-desktop's OWN packaged session file (budgie-desktop.desktop)
# launches labwc -- that's not something a package swap in the pacman
# list can change, since it's baked into the .desktop upstream ships,
# not anything this script writes. Budgie has no supported KWin session
# of its own (their FAQ: KWin is a maybe-someday Budgie 11 item, not
# something 10.10 -- what this image installs -- actually has); the
# only KWin session that exists at all is this one, straight from
# Buddies of Budgie's own (explicitly UNSUPPORTED/experimental,
# "no assistance" per that repo's own README) budgie-wayland-session
# testing repo, verbatim:
#   https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-wayland-session
#   desktop/budgie-desktop-kwinwayland.desktop
# --exit-with-session is KWin's equivalent of labwc's "-s": start the
# compositor, run this command as the session, exit when it exits.
# Caveat worth knowing: Budgie's gsettings→labwc "bridge" (keyboard
# shortcuts, touchpad, theming sync from Budgie Control Center) has no
# KWin counterpart, so none of that syncs here -- KWin's own config
# has to be set directly instead. See KWIN CONFIG note near the
# top-panel CSS.

# labwc IS still installed -- it's a hard `depends=()` of the
# budgie-desktop Arch package itself (confirmed straight from the
# package's own PKGBUILD/dependency list), not something `packages.x86_64`
# not listing it explicitly can prevent pacman from pulling in. It just
# never gets LAUNCHED anymore, since GDM now execs the KWin session
# above instead of budgie-desktop.desktop -- and since nothing ever
# starts the labwc binary, nothing ever parses rc.xml or throws the
# "Invalid action... 'command'" labnag popup from the screenshots
# (that error is labwc's OWN startup log format complaining about its
# own config -- it can only appear if labwc itself is the thing that
# ran).
#
# What budgie-desktop ALSO ships, though, is an autostart entry
# (/etc/xdg/autostart/org.buddiesofbudgie.labwc-bridge.desktop) that
# unconditionally runs usr/lib/budgie-desktop/labwc_bridge.py at every
# login regardless of which compositor is actually active -- it's what
# was regenerating rc.xml (with the "command" vs "Execute" action-name
# bug) fresh on every single login, which is why deleting the file
# alone never stuck. Harmless with labwc never running (nothing reads
# what it writes anymore), but pointless busywork every login, so mask
# it the standard per-user XDG way: a same-filename override in skel's
# own autostart dir with Hidden=true, which takes priority over the
# system-wide copy in /etc/xdg/autostart/ for every new account.

# ── Panel config, schema verified straight from upstream source ──────────

# this isn't a guess:
#   ROOT_SCHEMA      = com.solus-project.budgie-panel          (hyphenated!)
#   TOPLEVEL_PREFIX  = /com/solus-project/budgie-panel/panels
#   PANEL_KEY_POSITION    = "location"       (not "position")
#   PANEL_KEY_SHADOW      = "enable-shadow"  (not "shadow")
#   PANEL_KEY_APPLETS     = "applets"        (flat ordered UUID list)
#
# GSettings equivalent:
#   ROOT_SCHEMA      = com.solus-project.budgie-panel
#   PANEL_SCHEMA     = com.solus-project.budgie-panel.panel
#   PANEL_PATH       = /com/solus-project/budgie-panel/panels/{uuid}/
#
# The panel schema is relocatable, so the UUID path is supplied directly
# to gsettings after the schema name.
#
# UPDATE — found the actual root cause of the giant-white-panel bug
# (screenshots showed what should've been a slim floating bar rendering
# as a near-fullscreen white rectangle, on more than one build/compositor,
# which never made sense as a compositor issue): pulled the real
# com.solus-project.budgie-panel.gschema.xml straight from budgie-desktop
# source. The "location" and "transparency" keys are enums, and GSettings
# enum nicks are case-sensitive — this whole block was writing 'BOTTOM'/
# 'TOP'/'NONE' (uppercase) against a schema whose actual nicks are
# lowercase ('bottom'/'top'/'none'). An enum write that doesn't match any
# defined nick doesn't error, it just silently falls back to the schema
# default -- which for "location" is 'none' (no screen edge at all). A
# panel with no assigned edge has nothing to size itself against, which is
# exactly the "unconstrained giant rectangle" shape in the photos.
# Fixed below and on the TOP panel + the liveuser duplicate path further
# down. (dock-mode, separately: also confirmed for real in that same
# gschema.xml — type b, default false, "resize to house content" — so
# that part was already correct.)

# "docker compose up" fail outright rather than just skip GPU passthrough.
#

# ── No firewall package on KibaOS ──────────────────────────────────────────
# ufw used to be in here, but its packaging hooks just don't behave
# inside this chroot build container, and it goes beyond just the
# `ufw enable` CLI call (confirmed — removing that one call wasn't even
# enough, something in ufw's own systemd-enable-time hooks still tries a
# /proc-dependent SSH-detection check and fails the same way, since
# there's no real /proc in this build environment). rather than keep
# fighting a third-party tool's chroot incompatibility for a
# build-time-only step that was never going to filter live traffic
# anyway, ufw's just gone entirely now. so KibaOS currently ships with no
# firewall configured by default — worth coming back to eventually (maybe
# straight nftables, or a different frontend) if network-facing hardening
# ever becomes a priority, but it's not a build-blocking concern for a
# desktop live/install image the way it'd be for a server image.

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PACMAN SHIM — `pacman` becomes a thin dispatcher in front of kiba
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The real pacman binary gets moved aside (NOT removed -- libalpm itself
# isn't touched, and kibapkg already never called the pacman binary
# anyway, it's pyalpm straight to libalpm) and /usr/bin/pacman becomes a
# small dispatcher script instead.
#
# What it does NOT do: try to reimplement pacman's CLI. That's a losing
# game -- makepkg, DKMS's pacman hooks, and any AUR helper all
# shell out to pacman with exact flag combinations and, in some cases,
# parse its stdout for specific fields. Silently rewriting any of that
# output format would break real tooling for a cosmetic win, which isn't
# a trade worth making.
#
# So the dispatcher only intercepts when BOTH are true:
#   1. stdout is a real terminal (a human is sitting at it, not a script
#      capturing output through a pipe or the DKMS/makepkg machinery)
#   2. the arguments exactly match one of a short list of common,
#      simple, interactively-typed invocations (pacman -S foo, -Syu,
#      -Ss term, etc.)
# Anything else -- any flag combo not on the list, any non-interactive
# invocation, `-U` for local package files, `-T` dependency checks,
# `--asdeps`, multiple mixed flags, whatever makepkg/DKMS actually use --
# execs the real binary with the ORIGINAL argv, completely unmodified.
# The net effect: someone typing `pacman -S firefox` out of habit gets
# kiba's plain-language output; every script, hook, and build tool on the
# system keeps talking to the genuine pacman/libalpm exactly as before,
# because from their side nothing changed.

# ── kiba-tcpmask: outbound TCP/IP fingerprint mask ───────────────────────
# Rewrites the two heaviest-weighted fields in classic active/passive OS
# fingerprinting (nmap -O, p0f) on every locally-generated SYN and
# SYN-ACK before it leaves the box: IP TTL and initial TCP window size.
# Stock Linux defaults (TTL 64, window ~64240-ish depending on MTU/scale)
# are exactly what nmap/p0f signature databases key "Linux" off of.
# Rewriting them to Windows 10/11's classic defaults (TTL 128, window
# 65535) flips the top-line guess on both tools without touching
# anything user-visible -- no GUI, no config anyone opens, nothing in
# /etc/os-release, no libc-level uname() shim.
#
# Deliberately NOT touching TCP option order/presence (MSS/WScale/SACK/
# Timestamp ordering, also fingerprinted) -- doing that means rewriting
# option bytes in place without changing total header length, and
# getting it wrong risks silently breaking window scaling or SACK on
# real connections. TTL + window alone already move both tools off
# "Linux" as the top guess; that's the safe subset to ship.
#
# NFQUEUE + a tiny userspace daemon rather than a kernel patch (the old
# IP Personality approach) -- IP Personality only ever supported 2.4-era
# kernels and never got a modern port, so a netfilter-queue callback is
# the current equivalent that actually works against `linux` today.

# SECURITY — AppArmor, Firejail
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# AppArmor: the LSM itself is only live if apparmor is in the kernel's
# lsm= boot param (baked into /etc/kernel/cmdline and bundled into the
# UKI for installed systems; see kiba_install_finish.c's
# kiba_install_finalize()).
# Enabling the service here
# just makes it load whatever profiles ship in /etc/apparmor.d/ at boot
# once that param is active -- profile enforcement (aa-enforce/aa-complain
# for individual apps) is left to Remi/the end user, since KibaOS doesn't
# curate its own profile set.
systemctl enable apparmor

# Firejail: firecfg symlinks /usr/local/bin/<app> -> /usr/bin/firejail for
# every desktop app it recognizes a sandbox profile for (found by scanning
# /usr/share/applications), so e.g. the browser launches sandboxed by
# default without anyone having to type `firejail chromium` by hand.
# NOTE: firejail's own namespace/seccomp sandboxing and AppArmor's
# path-based enforcement have been reported to step on each other for
# some apps (an app both jailed AND under a restrictive profile can get
# denied in confusing ways) -- if something sandboxed misbehaves, check
# `aa-status`/`journalctl` for AppArmor DENIED lines before assuming it's
# just a firejail bug.

# ── PanelFix: provision liveuser's Budgie panel/dock for real, at real
# boot, instead of faking a D-Bus session in this chroot ──────────────────
# The old approach ran `dconf write` through `dbus-run-session` right here
# at ISO-build time, inside this chroot -- no X11, no logind session, no
# real session bus, just dbus-run-session trying to cobble one together
# cold. Most of the time that limped along; sometimes dbus-daemon decided
# to try autolaunching a bus via X11 anyway ("Cannot autolaunch D-Bus
# without X11 $DISPLAY"), returned non-zero, and -- because this whole
# script runs under `set -e` -- took the entire customize_airootfs.sh (and
# therefore the whole ISO build) down with it.
#
# Fix: don't touch dconf in the chroot at all. Ship a script plus a
# systemd --user unit, and let it run once liveuser's REAL desktop session
# is up. By the time systemd's user manager reaches graphical-session.target
# there's an actual, logind-managed session bus at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus
# with DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS already exported for anything that target
# pulls in -- so the script below just calls `dconf` directly, no
# dbus-run-session wrapper, because there's a real bus to talk to this time.

# aarch64 via systemd-boot (see the boot menu section and

# and the fork's _make_boot_on_fat_aarch64 copies /boot/Image* onto the
# live medium directly -- ALARM already ships that file, no renaming or
# repackaging required. Called with an explicit -k/-g instead of -p
# linux specifically to sidestep ALL_kver resolution: mkinitcpio's normal
# path-based kernel-version detection wants to inspect a vmlinuz file
# that plain ALARM installs never produce (only /boot/Image[.gz], which
# aren't in a format mkinitcpio's version-sniffing understands), so
# an explicit -k is required rather than hoping ALL_kver resolves
# against a file that was never there in the first place. That -k
